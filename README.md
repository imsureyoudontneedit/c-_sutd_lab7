**This repository was created to display the result of laboratory work on programming in C#.**
All the work is done using WindowsForms and TabControl. Each window is designed for its own task:
1. Checking the division of a number by 3
2. Changes the background color when it is selected in the list
3. Draws a graph of user clicks
4. A simple calculator
